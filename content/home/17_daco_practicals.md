Here you can find practical material for the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (DACO) course, taught at the Faculty of Engineering/University of Porto, in its 2017/18 edition.

This year, I am the teaching instructor for the practical sessions, and I also teach some theory.
Below you will find content associated to the practical lectures. I will probably be updating this each week.
