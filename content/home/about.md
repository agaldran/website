# Biography

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the École de Tecnologie Superieure, Montréal. 
I work at the Laboratoire d'imagerie, de vision et d'intelligence artificielle (LIVIA), under the supervision of Prof. Ismail ben Ayed and Prof. Hervé Lombaert.
My current research is focused on Computer Vision for Medical Imaging applications, and Deep Learning methods that can be trained on scarce labeled data, with a focus on Weakly-Supervised and Self-Supervised approaches.
The main areas of application are Retinal and Histopathological Image Analysis. 

Previously I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at INESC-TEC, INstituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, in Porto (Portugal), under the supervision of Prof. Aurélio Campilho.
Before this, I worked on the design of new Image Restoration algorithms adapted for problems on which there is an attenuating media in between the observer and the imaged scene.
