# Biography

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at INESC-TEC, INstituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, in Porto (Portugal). I am based at the BioImaging Lab, within the C-BER research center, and conduct my research under the supervision of Prof. Aur√©lio Campilho.

My current work is focused on retinal image understanding, within the SCREEN-DR project. This is a joint INESC-CMU initiative to provide an end-to-end eye health-care system, based on retinal fundus image analysis. The tools of choice for this project are advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms. 

Previously, I have worked on the design of new Image Restoration algorithms adapted for problems on which there is an attenuating media in between the observer and the imaged scene.
